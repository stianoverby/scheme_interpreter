# Scheme Interpreter

In this project I will create a scheme interpreter in Haskell. Im following along with a tutorial _Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours_, that is available [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours).

Since taking a functional programming course at the University Of Oslo, I got inspired to dive deeper into the functional paradigm. In the university course I learned some R5RS Scheme, which is quite a minimalistic Lisp dialect mostly used for educational purposes. It is fun using a miniscule language, but I have for a long time longed for playing with a more powerful functional language, e.g. Haskell, Clojure or Elm. Earlier I have also had experience with writing some interpreters in both scheme and java, and I view it as a fun way of learning the tricks of the trade surronding a programming language.

Wish me luck!
